The main intention is extending the scope of geoinformation in the web beyond the "natural" highlights (POI's and routes). Some examples are shown below.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The focus is directed mainly on 
* geodata in two- and three dimensions
* multiscale interfaces   
* geoSlide approach
* integration in singlePage webapps.
